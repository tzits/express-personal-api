<p>It's rude not to let people know things like that. It's been a while since I've been too self concious about that sort of thing, especially with people I know. What I mean is that after three weeks together, you guys are kind of doomed. It all started back when I was a child. Long story short, my parents are weird and thus I am too. Anyway, this isn't a newspaper article, so I can't fill the entire page with text. Here's a penguin</p></div>

<p>So some more about me. I'm a 25 year old New Yorker now in California by way of Maine and Boston. In a former life I worked at a hostipal and did research/clinical trials. Basically listening to people with big degrees telling my bosses to do things and then the bosses had me make it happen. For a little bit it was pretty interesting, but then it got monotonous in a hurry. I left in March, and went for a very long hike for the next few months. You can see some of the places I stayed on the /campsites page. I only included good ones. Some of my other hobbies include, writing, reading, running, triathlons, bird watching, bull shitting, and eating desserts. I am also musically illiterate and listen to audiobooks and podcasts in lieu of music. A hope you enjoy the site and the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tzits/media_set?set=a.10207786445043988.1073741831.1380060301&type=3">pictures</a>. I took most of them and lived through all of them.<br>
